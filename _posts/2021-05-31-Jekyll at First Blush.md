> **Abstract**/**Snippet**. `Jekyll` is type of utility to realize the static site production task in form of blog, which is the prerequisite for me as a blogger, and it seems like a good choice to keep track of my learning process...

## **1. Basic Directory Tree Hierarchy**

​	For details of  basic configurations of Jekyll in Windows, see **installation of Jekyll in Windows**[^1], after this, a directory should be built for the GitHub Page based on `Jekyll`, note that in `cmd`, the tree structure can be generated by

```bash
cd Desktop\Opticcss.github.io
tree /f > saved_names.txt
```

​	The resulting directory structure (roughly) is as below, with the meaning of each file marked out in comments, note that `##` represents necessary, and `#^` is optional.

```javascript
.
├─Gemfile
├─_config.yml
├─_includes
├─_layouts
├─_posts
│  └────2021-XX-XX-XXX.md
├─_drafts
│  └────[OPTSxXXXX]_Template.md
├─_data
├─index.html
├─static
│  ├─css
│  ├─font
│  ├─img
│  ├─js
│  └─xml
├─pages
├─mater
│  └─[OPTSxXXXX]_Template
├─favicon.ico
├─.gitattributes
└─.gitignore
```

​	The including command is serious in the `markdown` language, so the `{` `%` `include file.xxx` `%` `}` notation is used to represent the command line, in real programming, the spaces and **\`** symbol should be omitted.

| `.` **as Parent Node** | **Usage**                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Gemfile`              | `##` for configurations and dependencies of `RubyGems`       |
| `_config.yml`          | `##` store the configuration data                            |
| `_includes`            | `##` include sessions, loaded in other files by<br />`{` `%` `include file.xxx` `%` `}` `for reuse` |
| `_layouts`             | `##` template of the pages                                   |
| `_posts`               | `##` store articles with format of `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`<br />`2021-XX-XX-XXX.md` |
| `_drafts`              | `##` store the unpublished files,<br />which do not have `title.MARKUP <!deprecated!>`<br />`[OPTSxXXXX]_Template.md` |
| `_data`                | `##` formatted data `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.csv`, referred by `site.data.members` |
| `index.html`           | `##` automatically converted by `Jekyll` if contains `YAML frontmatter` |
| `static`               | `#^` contains `.js`, `.css` and some image resources, similar to `[assets]`<br />`css`, `font`, `img`, `js`, `xml` |
| `pages`                | `#^` resource files used in indices of pages                 |
| `mater`                | `#^` resource files referenced by my blog<br />`[OPTSxXXXX]_Template` |
| `favicon.ico`          | `#^` the common icon file                                    |
| `.gitattributes`       | `#^` the GitHub attributes file                              |
| `.gitignore`           | `#^` the list of ignored file                                |

## **2. YAML for Configuration**

​	`YAML` syntax (`/ˈjæməl/`, a markup language[^2]) is of significant importance in manipulation of `Jekyll` `_config.yml`,  it saves the complexity of configuring the website by command-line. By setting the user-defined attributes, for example the configuration below specify the `UTF-8` encoding, the blog title and author, as well some copyright information. As for the URL, I'm planning to add one for myself, maybe when I grow up... `φ(゜▽゜*)♪`

```yaml
encoding: UTF-8

# SEO relevant information
title: optics_css Blog
description: optics_css's Blog
keywords: optics_css,Blog
author: optics_css
footerText: 'Copyright © 2021'

permalink: /posts/:year/:month/:day/:title.html
kramdown:
  auto_ids: true
  input: GFM
  syntax_highlighter: rouge
exclude: [...]

# configuration of domain
# baseurl configuration
# set to /[directory name] if the site is deployed in another directory under the root directory
domainUrl: ''
baseurl: ''
```

​	To quote these site values, using `site.xxx` for `xxx` property, for example, the value of `site.title` is just `optics_css Blog`.

​	In `YAML`, the array, which is denoted as (in `JavaScript`) `['dog', 'cat', 'catfish', 'dogfish']`, can be formed as "lines" `-` at the beginning of a set of conjunction lines, for example

```yaml
- cat
- dog
- catfish
- dogfish
```

​	This kind of array can also be represented inline, which is the same with `{animal: ['dog', 'cat', 'catfish', 'dogfish']}`, as

```yaml
anis: [dog, cat, catfish, dogfish]
```

​	Hence the combination of array and properties lead to the following notation, which defines the structure of the web page menu bar and the corresponding links in the `YAML` configuration file.

```yaml
# menu
menu:
  - title: Home
    url: /
  - title: Categories
    url: /pages/categories.html
  - title: Search
    url: /pages/search.html
  - title: Chat
    url: /pages/chat.html
  - title: About
    url: /pages/about.html
```

​	The `.markdown` file which form the main part of the blog, should contain the `YAML frontmatter`, which is commonly (my formal/standard)

```yaml
layout: ...
title:  "..."
author: Li Jinzhao
categories: [...]
image: ....jpg
tags: [...]
```

​	These variables are completely pre-defined, meanings of them are as below. Note that only `space` is allowed for indention in `YAML`, do not use `TAB` here.

| `Variable`                     | `Descriptions & Notices`                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `layout`                       | specify the template file in the `_layouts` direction,<br />note that no file extension is required |
| `permalink`                    | set the final URL address                                    |
| `published`                    | set to false if do not want to display a particular blog     |
| `date`                         | override the dates in article name,<br />in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT`,<br />the last number is always `+0800` (the time zone offset) |
| `category`, `categories`       | specify one or more categorical attributes for the blog,<br />these articles can be read according to `categories`<br />`categories` can be accessed through `YAML List` |
| `tags`                         | similar thing as `categories`                                |
| `other self-defined variables` | can also be referenced by `{` `{` `page.var` `}` `}` as others |

## **3. Jekyll + GitHub Pages**

​	Using GitHub Pages[^3], with help of `Jekyll`, it is sufficient to build a personal/individual website/blog, the blog based on these two services have following several properties:

- static, don't need any back-end language to support.
- totally free.
- no database support is required.
- some limits by the platform
  - space should not be greater than $1\rm\ G$.
  - monthly flow should not be greater than $100\rm\ G$.
  - cannot be updated $10$ times per hour.
  - cannot be equipped with comment function (this can be complemented by third-party services).

## **4. Small Tips for Publish Individual Blogs**

### **Internal links for Data Statistics**

​	Several links for GitHub users' personal activity data, dynamic ratings of activity data, and statistics on the most commonly used programming languages, they are correspond to three internal links as

```markdown
![Metrics](https://metrics.lecoq.io/Opticcss?template=classic&config.timezone=Asia%2FShanghai)
![Optic_css's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Opticcss&show_icons=true&theme=radical)
![Optic_css's Most used languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Opticcss&layout=compact&hide_border=true&langs_count=10)
```

​	Inevitably, these services are limited to the consumer and throw error of `maximum retries exceed` when exceeded, and there may hint one to add an environment variable as `PAT_1` with GitHub token in `vercel`, maybe this will help...
