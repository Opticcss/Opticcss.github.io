## **1. Basic Directory Tree Hierarchy**

​	For details of  basic configurations of Jekyll in Windows, see **installation of Jekyll in Windows**[^1], after this, a directory should be built for the GitHub Page based on `Jekyll`, note that in `cmd`, the tree structure can be generated by

```bash
cd Desktop\Opticcss.github.io
tree /f > saved_names.txt
```

​	The resulting directory structure (roughly) is as below, with the meaning of each file marked out in comments, note that `##` represents necessary, and `#^` is optional.


```bash
#^ the list of ignored file
```
