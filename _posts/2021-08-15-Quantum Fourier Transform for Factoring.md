> **Abstract**/**Snippet**. Quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is kind of algorithm to implement the Fourier transform on quantum state by quantum computer, it could be used as subroutine of the quantum phase estimation. This article performs the demonstration of its principle and try to construct a corresponding quantum circuit for it.
