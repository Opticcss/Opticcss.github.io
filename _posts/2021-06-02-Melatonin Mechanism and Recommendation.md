> **Abstract**/**Snippet**. Melatonin, as kind of prescription drug/dietary supplement, is used in jet lag, delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), some sleep disorders, and the anxiety symptoms before and after treatment, etc. In the past few years, those born in the 1990s who bought imported sleep-aid products accounted for $62\%$ of the total consumers, and those who bought melatonin products accounted for $85\%$. On the other hand, the incidence of insomnia in people over 65 years of age is $20\sim50\%$, i.e., both the demand for melatonin and its associated range of action have increased considerably... ...

​	Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine, 褪黑激素/褪黑素/N-乙酰-5-甲氧基色胺), originally, a **hormone** produced in brain🧠 under dark condition, and **play a role in adjusting the circadian rhythms/biological clock** (discussed in [1.](# 1-mechanism-of-melatonin)). Its secretion is blocked by light, i.e., increases during the day and decreases at night ([1.1, 1.2](# effect-of-light-on-melatonin))... Its chemical structure is[^1]

​	Lots of people use it as a sleep aid, which are mostly retrieved from microorganisms/animals, but **<u>"natural" doesn't always mean "safe"</u>**... Actually, there hasn't been enough researches on the side effects of its long-term use, what is more, it is only known to all that melatonin regulate the body far more than it does as a sleep aid, but details of what those effects are has not been discovered...

## **1. Mechanism of Melatonin**

​	Melatonin, naturally is kind of highly lipid soluble (高脂溶性) hormone produced in brain pineal gland (松果体). It is synthesized from (predecessor) amino acid tryptophan (氨基酸色氨酸) and then released into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (脑脊液), crossing the blood-brain barrier (血脑屏障)[^2]. It sends messages to the receptor agonist (受体激动剂) in the brain and other areas of the body to help control the sleep and wake cycles.

![[OPTSx1890]_Mechanism](/assets/images/[OPTSx1890]_Mechanism.svg)

​	The chemical mechanism in detail is described in[^3], as below.

![[OPTSx1890]_Chemical_Mechanism_in_Detail](/assets/images/[OPTSx1890]_Chemical_Mechanism_in_Detail.svg)

​	When taken as supplement, it will functional as the effects of the natural hormone. **Drowsiness generally occurs within $\mathbf{30\text{ }min}$ after taking a dose** (this time period is approximately the time of hormone functioning at brain). Finally, the conclusion is raised,

> **NIGHTTIME MELATONIN LEVELS AFFECT THE QUALITY OF SLEEP DIRECTLY**

### **Effect of Light (Intensity) on Melatonin**

​	The secretion of melatonin is affected by (the intensity of) light (measured in $\text{lux}$), as a demonstration, the experiment utilize different light intensity (of $500\text{ lux}$, $2500\text{ lux}$, $1500\text{ lux}$, and in the dark)[^4]. The experiment results is obvious, which yields that

> the release of endogenous melatonin is increased each day in response to darkness, and reach its peak between 11 post meridiem and 3 ante meridiem at roughly $200\text{ picograms}$ per $\text{mL}$, on the other side, the night time levels are roughly $\times10$ higher than in the daytime. Levels fall sharply before daylight, and are barely detectable in the daylight hours. The rise and fall in endogenous levels signal wake and sleep times, which is so called the circadian rhythm.

​	Furthermore, the melatonin secretion can also be prevented by the using of one's smart phone/television (also by the light), one's age (high ages will also inhibits the release of melatonin at night), and also by the seasons (in summer, the production cycle is shorter, but in winter, the production cycle is longer). All these effects finally operate on the seasonal rhythms and the circadian rhythms[^5].

![[OPTSx1890]_Physiology_of_Melatonin](/assets/images/[OPTSx1890]_Physiology_of_Melatonin.svg)

​	The mechanism of this kind of effect based on photic information[^6] is conveyed to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN, 视交叉上核), principally through the retino-hypothalamic tract (RHT), where it synchronizes the activity of the circadian oscillator to exactly 24 h. Neuronal efferent pathways from the SCN directly distribute circadian information to different brain areas, including the pineal gland, that generates the melatonin rhythm. The neural route for environmental lighting control of melatonin secretion, after relay in the paraventricular nuclei (PVT), includes the intermediolateral column of the thoracic chord grey (ILC) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). The generated melatonin rhythm might be used by the SCN to distribute its rhythmic information. Melatonin can feed back at the level of the SCN, as well as the retina itself. A melatonin-driven circadian rhythm of sensitivity to melatonin may exist in the structure(s) involved in seasonality.

## **2. Melatonin for Sleeping**

​	Firstly, to avoid misunderstanding, the chronic insomnia always means that unable to sleep or stay asleep for a month or more, so **instead of taking medicine (like melatonin) every time you can't sleep, it is recommended to exercise or change other healthy methods**... Furthermore, this is also not supported in the guidelines proposed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and American College of Physicians in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as

> There’s not enough strong evidence on the effectiveness or safety of melatonin supplementation for chronic insomnia to recommend its use. The American College of Physicians guidelines strongly recommend the use of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I, 认知行为疗法) as an initial treatment for insomnia.

​	To better understand one's current sleep situation, check oneself for any of the following symptoms

- loss of appetite, palpitation, or chest tightness.
- poor memory, poor concentration, slow psychomotor speed (can't react quickly enough to keep up with other people's ideas), or impaired executive function (indecisiveness, have difficulty in making decisions, and severe procrastination).

​	Note that these are symptoms which are caused by insomnia, and these depressions (with insomnia) will cause and effect each other in a vicious circle, hence should be treated seriously.

### **Safety Considerations when Taking Melatonin**

​	Like other hormones, melatonin, as a hormone, will naturally have some adverse effects if taken at a dose much higher than the normal level in the body. For most people, it is safe to take melatonin in small doses for a short period of time. But for the old Alzheimer's patients, this should be quitted (suggested the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, in 2015, the reason is that melatonin may remain active longer in the elderly than in the young. In turn, the olds are likely to have no spirit even during daytime).

​	For common people, it is said the following side effects maybe occurred by taking melatonin (samples are of adults, surgical patients and critically ill patients, examined for a short period of time),

- headache, dizziness, nausea, sleepiness.

​	As for other side effects, in some individuals, the use of melatonin may result in a decrease in physiological needs (a decrease in sexual function in men) but there is no loss of fertility or sperm effect, and the majority of these conditions are reversible when they stop taking the drugs.

​	The use of Melatonin is subtle, as it is defined as a dietary supplement in U.S. (by the Food and Drug Administration) but as a prescription drug in many other countries, many supplements with the name melatonin contain substances that are not on their list ($26\%$ of them even contain small doses of harmful serotonin). Therefore, for security reasons, the following list should be noted

- avoid driving for at least $4\text{ h}$ after taking melatonin.
- avoid using this medication with other prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or dietary supplements without asking doctor, pharmacist or other healthcare provider (to avoid drug interactions).
- avoid alcohol while taking this medication.
- avoid coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, or other products that contain caffeine, as they may counteract the effects of the melatonin.
- avoid other unknown allergic reactions or unsuitable menstrual periods (ex. pregnant or lactating women).

### **Recommended Dose**

​	If really necessary, it should be known the corresponding dose for taking melatonin, **for jet lag, the effective starting doses is from $\mathbf{0.3}$ to $\mathbf{0.5\text{ mg}}$** (maybe half the pills), higher doses may be associated with more side effects as above shows. One is **recommended to always start with the lowest dose**, according to Cochrane review[^7] (although much higher doses are available for sale in the U.S.).

​	The following conditions (or disease) are incompatible with melatonin (BANNED)

- diabetes, depression, or bleeding or blood clotting disorder such as haemophilia.
- taking a blood thinner like warfarin.
- high or low blood pressure.
- epilepsy or other seizure disorder.
- using medicine to prevent organ transplant rejection.
- autoimmune condition.
- using other sedatives or tranquilizers.

### **Another Way of Natural Fetching/Retrieving**

​	Naturally, many foods carries small amounts of melatonin, for example [^8], maybe one can also gain melatonin by eating these foods, which is undoubted a better idea by directly take them as medicine (these, of course, cannot affect melatonin levels significantly)... ...

- tomatoes🍅, potatoes🥔, almonds, walnuts.

​	it is also worth trying to combine them with foods rich in tryptophan (色氨酸) which stimulates melatonin production naturally, with


- bananas🍌, oranges🍊, cherries🍒, nuts, oat.

### **Recommended for Better Sleep, a Non-Pharmacological Way**

​	Non-pharmacological interventions can be treated as another method to treat insomnia, which includes (these can also be used as some advices for better sleep)

- maintain a comfortable place to sleep, without bright light and sound interference, maintain the temperature within $16^\circ\text{C}\sim20^\circ\text{C}$.
- exercise regularly, but try not to do it $3\text{ h}$ before bed.
- eat regularly, do not go to bed on an empty stomach, eat a little snacks before bed, but to avoid greasy or indigestible food.
- try to avoid alcohol, strong tea, coffee (or other beverages high in caffeine), smoking a few hours before going sleep, but note that wine contains notable amounts of melatonin (ex. chardonnay, it may make one feel sleepy).
- help yourself fall asleep by breathing relaxation (inhale - hold the breath - exhale), listen to soothing, relaxing music with low volume, or get out of bed and go for a walk...
- Jujube (seed), lily, longan, lotus seed, propolis are also useful for relieving depression and tranquilizing one's mind.

​	All in all, there are still many topics and unknowns related to melatonin, for other information, see [^9][^10].
